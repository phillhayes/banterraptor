For Whom the Bell Tolls  -25/08/2014

The mixture of emotions within the camp was palpable. For some, the gravity of the task to come laid visibly heavy, with a sadness around the eyes associated with a man doing his lap of honour. The awareness of his possible impending demise never too far from his visage, and his reluctance to participate fully in the night's conversation a dead giveaway that matters of his own mortality were at the forefront of his mind.

Others wore a solemn sense of duty. A steadfast look of steel and determination. A look that acknowledged that they were merely a pawn in a much larger game, that their actions would transcend the here and now and resonate with generations of Spaniards to come. This realisation led to a healthy sense of cameraderie and brotherhood, full participation in the night's frivolities were part and parcel of the movement. If you are going to change history you cannot do it alone.

I sat there trying to weiogh up who fell into which category. It was difficult to tell with some people. The vast majority of my comrades were experienced campaigners with a strong notion of the "game face". They knew how to hid their emotions well. For others, it was far more noticeable. Their distance from the present moment, or full immersion in it provided a window to their soul, an insight into their true mindset.
